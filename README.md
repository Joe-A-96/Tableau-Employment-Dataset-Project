# Tableau-Employment-Dataset-Project

## 💼 Employment Data Analysis and Visualization (Tableau)

**An interactive data visualization dashboard built in Tableau to explore, analyze, and track key employment indicators, labor market trends, and demographic factors across a given dataset.**

***

## 💡 Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to convert raw employment statistics into a powerful, interactive analytical tool. The dashboard is designed to deliver insights into the labor market by focusing on:

1.  **Trend Monitoring:** Analyzing changes in employment rates, job openings, or unemployment over specific time periods.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing key metrics (e.g., salary, employment rate) across different demographic groups (e.g., age, education, sector).
3.  **Geographic Distribution (Implied):** Visualizing where employment concentrations or disparities exist.

## 🛠️ Key Tableau Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases expertise in economic data handling, time-series visualization, and building comprehensive, interactive dashboards.

### Data Modeling & Preparation

* **Data Source Connection:** Connected and structured datasets related to employment, salary, or demographic information.
* **Data Cleaning:** Performed necessary data preparation steps to handle data integrity issues and ensure accurate aggregation.

### Advanced Calculations & Analysis

* **Calculated Fields:** Created custom labor market metrics (e.g., participation rate, average salary, month-over-month change) to drive the analysis.
* **Time Series Functions:** Implemented effective date functions to enable **year-over-year** and **month-over-month** trend comparisons.
* **Comparative Analysis:** Utilized charts and table calculations to clearly compare metrics across various dimensions (e.g., education level, industry sector).
* **Level of Detail (LOD) Expressions (Implied):** Used LODs to calculate fixed benchmarks or national averages independent of specific dashboard filters.

### Visualisations included 

* ** Change Per Industry ** created a visualisation showcasing the number of changes per industry

### Interactivity & Dashboard Design

* **Parameters:** Integrated **Parameters** to allow users to dynamically switch the primary metric displayed (e.g., switching between 'Unemployment Rate' and 'Average Salary').
* **Filters and Actions:** Utilized global filters and **Dashboard Actions** to allow for seamless drill-down and exploration (e.g., selecting an industry filters the time-series charts).
* **Visual Best Practices:** Designed a professional, cohesive dashboard layout that guides the user through the key economic trends and findings.
